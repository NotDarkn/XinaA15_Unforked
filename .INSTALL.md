# How to properly install XinaA15
As stated many times at this point, this is a **IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.** Always use with precaution.

**Precautions & Help:** [**WARNINGS.md**](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/WARNINGS.md) - **Supported Devices/iOS:** [**SUPPORTED.md**](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/SUPPORTED.md)

1. Install TrollStore from the opa334 GitHub, installation instructions & info can be found there too: [**opa334/TrollStore**](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore)

2. After installing TrollStore, download the XinaA15 IPA from [this GitHub](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/releases) OR [**jacksight's GitHub**](https://github.com/jacksight/xina520_official_jailbreak/releases)

3. Once downloaded open the IPA with TrollStore and install the IPA.

4. After the IPA is installed, go to TrollStore settings and tap **Install idid**, this is required to open the XinaA15 app.

5. Once it's fully installed, open the XinaA15 jailbreak and **UN-CHECK SAILY.** DO NOT USE SAILY. **EVER.**

6. After unchecking Saily, tap `openJailbreak` to start the jailbreak process.

7. Your device will most likely reboot, you may want to check the XinaA15 app again to make sure it says "Currently in jailbreak state", but once it says that you are now in the jailbreak. Congrats.
