# How to install XinaA15
**Make sure to take the following precautions warned here: [**WARNINGS.md**](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/WARNINGS.md)**

As stated many times at this point, this is a **IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.** Always use with precaution.

1. Make sure you have a supported device, please check [**SUPPORTED.md**](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/SUPPORTED.md)

2. Install TrollStore from the opa334 GitHub, installation instructions & info can be found there too: [**opa334/TrollStore**](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore)

3. After installing TrollStore, download the XinaA15 IPA's from here OR [**jacksight's GitHub**](https://github.com/jacksight/xina520_official_jailbreak/releases)

4. Once downloaded open the IPA with TrollStore and install the IPA.

5. After the IPA is installed, go to TrollStore settings and tap **Install idid**, this is required to open the XinaA15 app.

6. Once it's fully installed, open the XinaA15 jailbreak, and **UN-CHECK SAILY.** DO NOT USE SAILY. EVER.

7. After unchecking Saily, tap **openJailbreak** to start the jailbreak process.

8. Your device will most likely reboot, you may want to check the XinaA15 app again to make sure it says "Currently in jailbreak state", but once it says that you are now in the jailbreak. Congrats.
