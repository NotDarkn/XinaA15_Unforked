# XinaA15 (GitHub) Reworded
XinaA15 is an iOS 15.0 to 15.1.1 jailbreak made for A12 and above devices in mind. The person who makes XinaA15 however is Chinese, so their translations and grammar is absolutely horrendous when reading it in English.

 This GitHub is intended to fix all of the grammar mistakes and make the release notes look a lot nicer.
 
 Everything such as the Sileo-fix.ipa's, the XinaA15.ipa's, and more are all from the official GitHub, the only edits I am making are the text files and their grammar.
