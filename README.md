# XinaA15 Reworded
XinaA15 is a jailbreak made for iOS 15.0 up to 15.1.1. Currently, it is made with A12+ devices in mind, such as the iPhone XR, XS, 11, 12, and 13. 
It is unsure if XinaA15 will add more versions to support XinaA15, so time will tell for the time being.

# This is not the official XinaA15 GitHub!
This GitHub is meant to fix all of the grammar and spelling mistakes created by Xina and Jacksight, as they are Chinese and are NOT native English speakers.
All of the release notes, README's, and more are all re-created in this GitHub to be more "understandable" for English speakers.

# Files unaffected:
- Sileo IPA's
- Xina IPA's
- Links found in this README.md
