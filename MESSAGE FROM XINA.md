# **This jailbreak is made by the developer @xina520.** 
# Most of the grammar was corrected by Discord user: "alucard#2478" (Thanks alucard for making my job easier!)

**Warning!**

XinaA15 currently supports Sileo, ssh, libsubstitiute, Libhooker, Procursus repo, BigBoss repo, Tweak injection, and etc.

If your storage in iCloud is full, the permanent signature will become invalid after the space is restarted. It may also lead to some other problems. The current cause is unknown (to be fixed.)

**Environment repair**

If your environment is damaged, you can restart your phone, turn on the "rebuild jailbreak rnvironment" switch, and then press "open jailbreak" to re-jailbreak.

If you encounter a Sileo 522 error, you can try clearing Sileo's cache to fix it. If it's still erroring however, try resetting your iPhone/iPad settings.

**Supported development environments**

Compatible with all development environments you currently use.
Currently, the debug server fully supports the debugging of additional processes (you don't need to do anything.)

**Developers!**

There's no need to change the theos or change anything, but what you may need to change is the relevant path in your code (the path in the deb package does not need to be changed, and nothing needs to be changed)

Full support for make install
Full support for make uninstalll
Full support for make do

For the normal use and installation of iOSOpendev, no changes are required.

Compile the log. 

During the compilation process, the console will display the current log. Please ignore it.

If the console displays as follows:

ldid: Unknown header magic

Are you sure that is a Mach-O?

ldid: operator(): No such file or directory

make uninstall

make installl
