# Quick brief note:
Just like with any recent jailbreak as of iOS 14, no (stable) jailbreak currently supports every single iOS version of a new major version of iOS.

For example, many jailbreaks these days don't support the entirety of iOS 14.x, unc0ver got close, but couldn't. Plus unc0ver is extremely buggy so not worth it.

Anyways, make sure to take any precautions when using this on your device.
