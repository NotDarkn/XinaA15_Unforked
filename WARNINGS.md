# BE WARNED, THIS IS A IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.

This jailbreak was **NOT** made for normal public use, and because of that you WILL encounter issues at some point.

Not only that, but this jailbreak is a **rootless jailbreak.** There will be **MANY TWEAKS** that do not support rootless, and will need to be updated to support rootless environments. If you install a root-only tweak, then you may encounter any of the issues below. Please be careful of what you install.

Issues that COULD occur if used wrong:
- Bootlooping
- Losing data
- Accidental deletion of system apps
- Broken jailbreaks
- Accidental updating

Please make sure to take the following precautions to prevent any damage on your iPhone device:
- Backup your iPhone through iTunes, you may encrypt the backup or not, up to you.
- Save as many blobs as you can, it is recommened to use the AutoTSS bot from the r/jailbreak Discord.
- Do not install any dangerous tweaks from any dangerous repos, such as trying to join piracy.

All in all, don't be retarded and use your common sense.
