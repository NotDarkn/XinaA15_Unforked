# BE WARNED, THIS IS A IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.

This jailbreak was **NOT** made for normal public use, and because of that you WILL encounter issues at some point.

Not only that, but this jailbreak is a **rootless jailbreak.** There will be **MANY TWEAKS** that do not support rootless, and will need to be updated to support rootless environments. If you install a root-only tweak, then you may encounter any of the issues below. Please be careful of what you install.

**Issues that COULD occur if used wrong:**
- **Device bootlooping** - (ex: Apple Logo repeatedly booting)
- **Data loss in apps or iOS** - (ex: Save files, in-game data)
- **Deletion of System Apps** - (ex: Settings, Messages, gone)
- **Future jailbreaks breaking** - (ex: can't jailbreak anymore)
- **Accidental iOS updating** - (ex: Updated to 16.2)

Please make sure to take the following precautions to prevent any damage on your iPhone device:
- **Backup your iPhone** through iTunes, you may encrypt the backup or not, up to you.
- **Save as many blobs** as you can, it is recommened to use the AutoTSS bot from the r/jailbreak Discord.
- **Do not install any dangerous tweaks** from any dangerous repos, such as trying to join piracy.

All in all, don't be retarded and use your common sense.
