If you choose to jailbreak using XinaA15, **YOU** are the person who is responsible with any damages that encounter on your device.

Please take the proper precautions below.

# AS USUAL, CHECK IF YOUR DEVICE IS SUPPORTED
If you don't check this, you are more likely to run into issues or even break your device.
Please check the [supported devices](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/SUPPORTED.md) list before doing anything.

# BE WARNED, THIS IS A IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.

This jailbreak was **NOT** made for normal public use, and because of that you WILL encounter issues at some point.

Not only that, but this jailbreak is a **rootless jailbreak.** There will be **MANY TWEAKS** that do not support rootless and will need to be updated to support rootless environments. If you install a root-only tweak, then you may encounter any of the issues below. Please be careful of what you install.

**Issues that COULD occur if used wrong:**
- **Device bootlooping** - (ex: Apple Logo repeatedly booting)
- **Respring looping** - (ex: Forever loading spring icon)
- **Data loss in apps or iOS** - (ex: Save files, in-game data)
- **Deletion of System Apps** - (ex: Settings, Messages, gone)
- **Future jailbreaks breaking** - (ex: can't jailbreak anymore)
- **Accidental iOS updating** - (ex: Updated to 16.2)

Please make sure to take the following precautions to prevent any damage on your iPhone device:
- **Backup your iPhone.** - You can use iTunes on Windows or Finder on macOS to backup your phone.
- **Save as many blobs as you can.** - Saving blobs will allow you to downgrade back to a iOS version when needed.
- **Do not install any dangerous tweaks.** - Downloading dangerous tweaks / stuff from piracy repos may endanger your phone.

All in all, **don't be retarded and use your common sense.**
