# BE WARNED, THIS IS A IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.

This jailbreak was **NOT** made for normal public use, and because of that you WILL encounter issues at some point.

Not only that, but this jailbreak is a **rootless jailbreak.** There will be **MANY TWEAKS** that do not support rootless, and will need to be updated to support rootless environments. If you install a root-only tweak, then you may encounter any of the issues below. Please be careful of what you install.

**Issues that COULD occur if used wrong:**
- Device bootlooping (e.g. Apple Logo repeatedly)
- Data loss in apps or iOS (e.g. e 4M gold to 0 gold)
- Deletion of System Apps (e.g. Settings gone)
- Future jailbreaks breaking (e.g. can't jailbreak)
- Accidental iOS updating (e.g. iOS 15.1 to 16.2)

Please make sure to take the following precautions to prevent any damage on your iPhone device:
- Backup your iPhone through iTunes, you may encrypt the backup or not, up to you.
- Save as many blobs as you can, it is recommened to use the AutoTSS bot from the r/jailbreak Discord.
- Do not install any dangerous tweaks from any dangerous repos, such as trying to join piracy.

All in all, don't be retarded and use your common sense.
